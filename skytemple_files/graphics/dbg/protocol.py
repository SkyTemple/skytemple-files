        Imports the palettes of the image to the DPL.

        The passed PIL will be split into separate tiles and the tile's palette index in the tile mapping for this
        coordinate is determined by the first pixel value of each tile in the PIL. The PIL
        must have a palette containing up to 16 sub-palettes with 16 colors each (256 colors).

        If a pixel in a tile uses a color outside of it's 16 color range, an error is thrown or
        the color is replaced with 0 of the palette (transparent). This is controlled by
        the force_import flag.

        The input images must have the same dimensions as the DBG (same dimensions as to_pil_single_layer would export).
