.org NA_022F488C	;Equip penalty - when you give a pokemon an item in the original game, its turn is skipped if it's a partner, but if the leader gives itself an item, its next turn isn't skipped. This causes a bug where, if a partner gives itself an item, its next turn is skipped, and if a partner gives the leader an item, the leader's next turn isn't skipped. Fixed so it works fairly: a pokemon doesn't lose its next turn if it gives itself an item, but if it gives an item to another pokemon, the other pokemon's turn is skipped.

This fixes it so temp party members are treated like regular party members when it comes to moves.
